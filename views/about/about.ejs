<br>
<p class="about-intro">We are a group of students and professionals who are all connected to each other by the love and passion of Web Development!</p>

<p class="about-description">We decided to create this blog to showcase our current skills and learn a lot about Web Devolpment in the process. Many people have contributed to this project, some of whom have basic knowledge of HTML and CSS, while others are more knowledgable in the more advanced topics of Devolpment and have watched over us throughout this journey. We hope you are able to enjoy the blog as much as we did in creating it. Below is a list of all the contributors to this blog, many thanks to each and everyone of them who took their time and effort to bring this blog to life! Happy Coding!!</p>
